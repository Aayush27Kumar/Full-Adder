# Full-Adder
A full adder is a digital circuit that adds three binary numbers together and produces two outputs: a sum and a carry.

Inputs: A full adder has three inputs: A, B, and C-IN (carry-in)
Outputs: A full adder has two outputs: S (sum) and C-OUT (carry-out)

A full adder is a circuit that has two AND gates, two EX-OR gates, and one OR gate.
A full adder is different from a half adder, which can only add two binary digits without considering a carry from a previous computation.
